Used an observatory file from EarthScope Data Server (https://gage-data.earthscope.org/archive/gnss/rinex/obs/2025/160/) and uploaded it to both programs tec-suite and TEC GPS.

- tec suite additionally required navigation files (acquired from https://gage-data.earthscope.org/archive/gnss/rinex/nav/2025/160/ under the same name as the observatory file) which are .h, .n and .g files. The program returned about 20 .dat files with TEC estimations for each satellite.
- TEC GPS returned one .Cmn file with TEC estimations and photos of graphs
